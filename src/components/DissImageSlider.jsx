            <p className="portfolio_description">
              I created a VR Basketball game in Unreal Engine 4 to test if the noise of a virtual crowd would affect a players performance such as it does in real life sports.
              I concluded that positive crowd noise positively affected the performance of the player while negative and silent crowds gave debatably inconclusive results.
              I had no prior experience in Unreal Engine 4 before this project. I picked it up from scratch and taught myself all I could to ensure I completed it with the best
              quality possible, achieving a First.  </p>
