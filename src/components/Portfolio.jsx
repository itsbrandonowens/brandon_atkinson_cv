                    <p className="portfolio_description"> I created a VR Basketball game in Unreal Engine 4 to test if the noise of a crowd would affect a players performance such as it does in real life sports.
                        I concluded that positive crowd noise positively affected the performance of the player while negative and silent crowds gave debatably inconclusive results. </p>
